  <p>
  I am a Hedrick Assistant Adjunct Professor in the <a href="https://www.math.ucla.edu/">Department of Mathematics</a> at UCLA, hosted by <a href="https://www.math.ucla.edu/~deanna/">Deanna Needell</a> and <a href="https://www.math.ucla.edu/~bertozzi/">Andrea Bertozzi</a>, where I also work closely with <a href="https://www.oscarleong.com/home">Oscar Leong</a>. Previously, I completed my PhD at <a href="https://www.cam.ac.uk/">University of Cambridge</a>, supervised by <a href="https://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/people/cbs31/">Carola-Bibiane Schonlieb</a>, and hold a double MSc from <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/en/">TU Delft</a> and <a href="https://www.tu.berlin/en/">TU Berlin</a>, and a double BSc from <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/en/">TU Delft</a>. 
  </p>
  <p>
  My research bridges Riemannian geometry, machine learning, and signal processing, which I use to develop <strong>interpretable and theory-grounded machine learning approaches</strong> for inverse problems, manifold learning, and data-driven modeling in the sciences.
  </p>
  <p>
  Beyond research, I enjoy teaching mathematics at UCLA, mentoring graduate and undergraduate students, and engaging in interdisciplinary collaborations. I am also an avid sailor, hiker, skier and snowboarder, and a classics and poetry enthusiast.
